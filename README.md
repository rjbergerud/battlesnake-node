##### documentation

To compile docs,
`npm run docs`
Add documentation in the JSdoc format, found [here](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html)

If you wish to edit the README, please do so on the README_snakespeare.md file.  It is used to autogenerate the README.md, so anything you add to README.md will be overwritten each time `npm run docs` is run.

The documentation.yml file is for configuring the documentation generator.

#### git-stuff

Use branches for feature development or personal experimentation: `git checkout -b some-new-branch-name`

Merge to master via Github pull requests.

#### testing

To run tests,
`npm test`

### Deploying to Heroku

Current Heroku deployment: <http://this-snake.herokuapp.com/>

Can be updated or replaced as development progresses.

## Docs from starter-snake

### battlesnake-node(js)

A simple [BattleSnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written in Javascript for NodeJS. Founded on the [Sendwithus starter snake](https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-node)

### Getting started (from Sendwithus)

See <https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake-node> for full details or to start a new snake from a blank slate.

To get started you'll need a working NodeJS development environment, and at least read the Heroku docs on [deploying a NodeJS app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs).

If you haven't setup a NodeJS development environment before, read [how to get started with NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/documentation/tutorials/). You'll also need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for easy JS dependency management.

This client uses [Express4](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) for easy route management, read up on the docs to learn more about reading incoming JSON params, writing responses, etc.

### Running the AI locally

Clone this repo via HTTPS or SSH.

Install the client dependencies:

    npm install

Create an `.env` file in the root of the project and add your environment variables (optional).

Run the server:

    nf start web

Test the client in your browser: <http://localhost:5000>

## API

## simple

Weighting scheme will assign 1 to edges going out
to vertices which are unoccupied

**Parameters**

-   `v1` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** from vertex
-   `v2` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** to vertex
-   `graph`  

Returns **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** weight

## Board

Class represents the board

### constructor

Create a board object.
The board will keep track of the request information
and keep the game states and other useful useful information

**Parameters**

-   `body` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** the body of the request

### createGraph

 See API of [Graph.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graph.js#Graph+toJSON)

**Parameters**

-   `grid` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)>** the grid of snakes
-   `rule` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)?** default sets all edges to open vertices value 0) w/ edge weight 1, 0 otherwise (optional, default `simple`)

Returns **Graph**
