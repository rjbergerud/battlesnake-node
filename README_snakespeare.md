##### documentation
To compile docs,
`npm run docs`
Add documentation in the JSdoc format, found [here](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html)

If you wish to edit the README, please do so on the README_snakespeare.md file.  It is used to autogenerate the README.md, so anything you add to README.md will be overwritten each time `npm run docs` is run.

#### git-stuff
Use branches for feature development or personal experimentation: `git checkout -b some-new-branch-name`

Merge to master via Github pull requests.

#### testing
To run tests,
`npm test`


### Deploying to Heroku

Current Heroku deployment: http://this-snake.herokuapp.com/
